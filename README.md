#  Pivot-based Entity Linking
  
Pivot-based entity linking (PBEL) is an entity linking method that uses high-resource languages as intermediates while doing low-resource cross-lingual entity linking. The details are described in the paper: [Zero-shot Neural Transfer for Cross-lingual Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04154).
